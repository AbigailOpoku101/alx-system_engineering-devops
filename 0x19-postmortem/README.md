Postmortem: Web Stack Outage
Issue Summary: 
Duration: June 12, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 13, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC) Impact: The online shopping service was inaccessible, resulting in a complete outage for all users. Users experienced an inability to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. The outage affected 100% of users during the specified duration.
Timeline:
•	10:00 AM: Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in HTTP 500 error responses.
•	Actions taken:
•	Investigated the frontend web servers and load balancers for potential issues.
•	Assumed high traffic or misconfiguration as the root cause and focused initial investigations accordingly.
•	Misleading investigation/debugging paths:
•	Explored network connectivity issues, ruling them out as the network stack appeared stable.
•	Analyzed the frontend web server logs, but no anomalies were found.
•	Incident escalated to:
•	The incident was escalated to the backend services team to investigate potential backend-related issues.
•	6:00 PM: Backend services team determined that a cascading failure in the database layer caused the outage.
•	Actions taken:
•	Investigated the database infrastructure, specifically focusing on performance metrics and error logs.
•	Identified excessive load on the primary database server, leading to resource exhaustion and subsequent connection failures.
•	Misleading investigation/debugging paths:
•	Initially suspected a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack due to the sudden increase in traffic but found no evidence to support this theory.
•	Considered a misconfiguration or bug in the database software, but all configurations were correct, and no known bugs matched the symptoms.
•	Incident resolved:
•	2:00 AM: Resolved the issue by offloading read operations to a read replica database server, alleviating the load on the primary server and restoring normal service.
•	Implemented connection pooling and optimized database queries to further improve performance and prevent future incidents.
Root Cause and Resolution: 
The root cause of the outage was identified as a cascading failure in the database layer. The primary database server experienced a sudden surge in traffic, leading to resource exhaustion and connection failures. This resulted in an inability to retrieve or modify data, causing the online shopping service to become unavailable. To resolve the issue, read operations were redirected to a read replica database server, reducing the load on the primary server and restoring service. Additionally, connection pooling was implemented, and database queries were optimized to enhance performance and mitigate similar incidents in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1.	Improve infrastructure scalability: Implement automated scaling mechanisms to handle unexpected traffic surges effectively.
2.	Enhance monitoring capabilities: Add proactive monitoring for database performance, resource utilization, and connection limits to detect and address potential issues in real-time.
3.	Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms: Set up multiple database replicas across different regions to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
4.	Conduct load testing: Regularly perform load testing to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the system accordingly.
5.	Update incident response protocols: Refine the incident response process, ensuring prompt escalation and involvement of relevant teams to expedite troubleshooting and resolution.
6.	Enhance logging and diagnostics: Improve the logging and diagnostic capabilities to capture more detailed information during incidents, aiding in root cause analysis.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
•	Implement automatic read replica promotion in case of primary database failure.
•	Configure and deploy connection pooling mechanisms to optimize resource utilization.
•	Conduct a thorough review of database configuration and query performance, identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks.
•	Enhance monitoring tools to provide real-time insights into database health and performance.
•	Document the incident, including findings, actions taken, and lessons learned, for future reference and knowledge sharing.
By implementing these measures, we aim to improve the resilience and performance of our web stack, ensuring a seamless user experience and minimizing the impact of potential future incidents.
